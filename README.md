# sevenangels

The alt-seven package was meant to be called seven-angels, but in JavaScript, variables can't start with a number, so we can't create a root level package called 7a and call 7a.remote.auth, we have to use a7.remote.auth. 

Why not just type it out, e.g. sevena.remote.auth? If you are asking that question, you must not write software for a living. That's too much typing, a7 is so much more concise. 

Just remember, alt-seven is seven-angels, a7 = 7a.

Who were the seven archangels? According to early Jewish and Christian tradition, they are the angels that tend humanity.

And so this framework tends humanity.

See the alt-seven repository for framework details.
