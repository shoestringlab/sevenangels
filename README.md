# sevenangels

The alt-seven package was meant to be called seven-angels, but in JavaScript, variables can't start with a number, so alt-seven it is.

Just remember, alt-seven is seven-angels.

Who were the seven archangels? According to early Jewish and Christian tradition, they are the angels that tend humanity.

And so this framework tends humanity.

See the alt-seven repository for framework details.
